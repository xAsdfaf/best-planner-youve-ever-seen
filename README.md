After hitting save, the text will be saved into local storage and will appear on refresh until it is deleted, or changed.

Along with this, there is an element displaying the Month, Day, and year, while also showing the current time from hour to minute to second.

The time-blocks also change color dependent on the time. 
time-blocks that have already passed will be grey,
time-blocks that are currently happening will be red,
time-blocks that are in the future will be green.
